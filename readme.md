## Twitter Tools

#### Unfollower
Unfollower is a simple tool that allows you to unfollow all the users who don't follow you back. To use this tool, open the "following" tab in your Twitter profile. Press f12 (or right click anywhere on the page and click inspect) to open developer tools. Open console tab, paste the code (that you copied from unfollow.js) and run it. After you run the code, it wil ask you how many times it should scroll the window (more scroll count = more users to visit). You will see the status on the screen while it is processing. If you want to interrupt scrolling process and start unfollowing with the loaded users immediately, just click the interrupt button.

#### Follower
Follower is an follow tool that allows you to follow new users automatically. Open your favorite user's profile (or your own profile). Click following or followers tab and run the code that you copied from the follow.js file (read the Unfollower's description to learn how to run the code). It will follow the loaded users that you are not following and display the status of the process.
